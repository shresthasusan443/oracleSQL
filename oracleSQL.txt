1.what is database?
	A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically.


2.what is oracle?
	Oracle is a Database Management System (DBMS) that allows businesses and developers to store, manage, and retrieve data using SQL (Structured Query Language). Oracle's architecture is designed to be highly reliable, scalable, and secure, making it ideal for mission-critical applications.

3.key concept of oracle

1.oracle database:
	This is the core product, and it’s responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data
in relational tables. Oracle Database also handles backup and recovery, user management, and security. It’s widely used in large-scale enterprise applications, data warehouses, and cloud services.

2.oracle SQL:
	SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.

3.oracle PL/SQL:
	PL/SQL (Procedural Language for SQL) is Oracle’s procedural extension to SQL. It enables the 
writing of programs (procedures, functions, triggers) that can be executed on the database server. 
PL/SQL allows for the inclusion of programming logic like loops, conditions, and exception handling 
in SQL operations.

4.oracle architecture
  a. instance:
	Consists of memory structures (SGA) and background processes that manage the interaction between users and the database.

  b. database
	The actual physical storage of the database.(datafiles, redo log files).

  c. schemas:
 	Logical container of database objects which are associated with users.(table, indexes, views).

  d. Tablespace:
	store structures that group data files together

5. oracle features:
1. Client/ Server Architecture- To take full advantage of the distributed systems, the oracle can allow processing to be split into client and server application programs. So, for the purpose of the distributed processing, it is based on client/server architecture.

2. Large database and Space Management- Oracle can support the largest of the databases. It allows the full control of space used so that hardware devices can be used efficiently.

3. High availability-It is never out of action or unavailable. Therefore, all the normal operations such as backups or partial failures do not interrupt the use of the database.

4. Many concurrent database users- Oracle server minimizes the disputes between the data and assures data concurrency.

5. Openness industry standards- Oracle follows the industry-accepted standards for the data access language, user interfaces, operating systems, and other network protocols. One of the advantages is that it is an “open” system that protects a customer’s investment.

6. Enforced database integrity- Oracle enforces data integrity which is the assurance of the consistency of the data. As a result, the costs of coding and managing checks in many database applications are removed.

7. Portability- Oracle software can be ported to work under a number of operating systems. Applications that are developed using Oracle can be ported to other operating systems without requiring any changes.

8.Compatibility-Oracle software is compatible with the standards of industries. Applications developed for oracle is compatible with many other systems without a need for much modification.

9. Controlled availability- Oracle also has a great feature of controllable availability and each and every level(even at sub-level). For Example, the administrator can also disable some specific applications to be packed or loaded without affecting other applications.

10. Concurrent processing- Oracle allows a number of concurrent users to execute a variety of applications concurrently. A number of applications can be run at the same time by using Oracle.

11. Replicating environments- Oracle software allows users to replicate groups of tables and their supporting objects to multiple sites.

12. High transaction processing performance- Oracle also maintains a high degree of overall system performance. The database users do not suffer from slow processing performance.

13. Manageable security- To protect against unauthorized database access and use, Oracle provides fail-safe security features to limit and monitor data access.

14. Distributed systems- Oracle is based on distributed systems that have the same degree of user transparency and data consistency as non-distributed systems with the advantages of local database management.

6. oracle components:
  a. data files:
	Datafiles are physical files of the operating system that store the data of all logical structures in the database

  b. control files:
	Control files store metadata about the database, such as its structure, status, and locations of datafiles and redo log files.

  c. redo log files:
	redo log files is a file that records changes made to the database.

  d. Table spaces:
	Tablespace in Oracle Database are logical storage units to store all the data. Logical storage units help users locate specific data and help in the retrieval of data.

  e. segments:
	segments is a collection of extents that hold all the data for a specific logical storage structure, like a table or an index, within a tablespace.

  f. extents and blocks:
	blocks is a smallest unit of a data storage.
	extents is a group of contiguous data blocks allocated together to store data for a specific object like a table or index. 

7. oracle SQL key concepts:
    a. DML(data manipulation language)
	1.SELECT:
		it selects the particular data from the database
	2.INSERT:
		adds new rows of data to a table
	3.UPDATE:
		update existing data within a table 
	4.DELETE:
		deletes database object

    b.	DDL(data definition language)
		1. CREATE:
			creates a new database such as table, index, function
		2. ALTER:
			it is used to add, modify, or drop/delete columns in a table
		3. DROP:
			deletes object from the database

    C.TCL(transaction control language)
		1. COMMIT:
			Saves all changes made during the transaction
		2. ROLLBACK:
			undoes the changes made during transactions. 

### Important SQL Commands
	1. SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a database.
	2. INSERT: Used to add new data to a database.
	3. UPDATE: Used to modify existing data in a database.
	4. DELETE: Used to remove data from a database.
	5. CREATE TABLE: Used to create a new table in a database.
	6.ALTER TABLE: Used to modify the structure of an existing table.
	7.DROP TABLE: Used to delete an entire table from a database.
	8. WHERE: Used to filter rows based on a specified condition.
	9.ORDER BY: Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
	10.JOIN: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
		
 8. oracle PL/SQL key concepts:
		PL/SQL (Procedural Language for SQL) is Oracle’s procedural extension to SQL. It enables the 
writing of programs (procedures, functions, triggers) that can be executed on the database server. 
PL/SQL allows for the inclusion of programming logic like loops, conditions, and exception handling 
in SQL operations.

		a.PL/SQL block structure:
			1.declaration section:
					The declaration section is required if any variables are to be used in a PL/SQL block. The declaration section also defines cursors, types, local procedures, and functions that are used in a block. If no variables or other elements need to be declared, then this section may be omitted.
			Several different types of variables may be defined in a PL/SQL block. You can use simple, scalar variables to hold numeric, character string, and date values. You can declare record 	variables that allow you to manipulate several related values together. You can even declare in-memory tables and arrays.
			
			SYNTAX:
				variable_name type [CONSTANT] [NOT NULL] [:=initial_value]

			2.execution section:
					The execution section of a PL/SQL block is the only required section. It contains the PL/SQL code that actually performs some action; the exception section also performs an action, but only after being triggered by an action in the execution section. 

			SYNTAX:
				BEGIN
				   {assignment_statement    |
				     proc_call    |
				     control_statement    |
				     PL/SQL_block    |
				     SQL
				
								};
				   [{assignment_statement    |
				     proc_call    |
				     control_statement    |
				     PL/SQL_block    |
				     SQL
				    }; . . . ]
				END;

			3.exception handling section:
				An exception is a PL/SQL error that is raised during program execution, either implicitly by TimesTen or explicitly by your program. Handle an exception by trapping it with a handler or propagating it to the calling environment.	
		
			Types:
			   -Predefined exceptions
			   -Non-predefined exceptions
			   -User-defined exceptions

		b. stored procedure and functions:
			1.store procedure:
				A SQL Stored Procedure is a collection of SQL statements bundled 	together to perform a specific task. These procedures are stored in the database and can be 	called upon by users, applications, or other procedures

			2. functions:
				In Oracle, a function block structure refers to the basic building block of a PL/SQL function, which consists of three distinct parts: a declarative section (variable declarations), an executable section (the actual code logic), and an exception handling section (to manage potential errors).

		c. triggers:
			triggers automatically execute when certain events(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs in table.
